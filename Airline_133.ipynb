Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told \\\"wait till drinks are served!\\\" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - \\\"prove it Sir\\\", that sealed it for us, if that\\u2019s the BA response to what\\u2019s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate.\",\n          \"Verified Review   Malta to Gatwick. This is for British Airways Catering Service Managers. They have invested a lot of time and money into your meal scheme so as to earn extra income rather than give free meals. Initially I was very impressed when I spied the M&S food and drink menu which does merit appreciation. However, on flight BA 2645 from Malta to Gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted. I am a strict vegetarian so I was happy to see the selection of vegetarian fayre but unfortunately by the time the trolley got to me (a long time I might add) there was no veggie sandwiches, no veggie focaccia, not even mixed nuts (for heavens sake!). Of course there was plenty for the non-vegetarians. Not only that but the Couscous Salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternative. I was very disappointed and BA need to do better. For me to fly with BA again I'd need some assurances that they will care just as much for the veggie people as for the meatheads.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Traveller_Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Solo Leisure\",\n          \"Couple Leisure\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Business Class\",\n          \"Unknown\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Start_Location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 332,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sydney\",\n          \"Montreal - Dorval (Montr\\u00e9al-Trudeau)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"End_Location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 411,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dusseldorf\",\n          \"Toronto\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Layover_Route\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"London / Seattle\",\n          \"Bahrain - Bahrain International Airport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Start_Latitude\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17.022013772316967,\n        \"min\": -37.66695115,\n        \"max\": 65.0118734,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          24.638916,\n          36.7213028\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Start_Longitude\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 44.57658736799027,\n        \"min\": -123.18290873596638,\n        \"max\": 151.2082848,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          46.7160104,\n          -4.4216366\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Start_Address\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 284,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"London Gatwick Airport, Perimeter Road East, Lowfield Heath, Crawley, West Sussex, England, RH6 0JJ, United Kingdom\",\n          \"Aeroporto di Milano-Malpensa, Via per Tornavento, Lonate Pozzolo, Unione dei comuni di Lonate Pozzolo e Ferno, Varese, Lombardia, 21015, Italia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"End_Latitude\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 18.723618701463405,\n        \"min\": -37.8142454,\n        \"max\": 64.145981,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 318,\n        \"samples\": [\n          42.3554334,\n          52.36652835\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"End_Longitude\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 46.045734678394,\n        \"min\": -123.179234,\n        \"max\": 174.5506104914412,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 318,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -71.060511,\n          13.488062884599568\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"End_Address\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 320,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\u7fbd\\u7530, \\u5927\\u7530\\u533a, \\u6771\\u4eac\\u90fd, 144-0043, \\u65e5\\u672c\",\n          \"\\u0645\\u0637\\u0627\\u0631 \\u062f\\u0628\\u064a \\u0627\\u0644\\u062f\\u0648\\u0644\\u064a, \\u0634\\u0627\\u0631\\u0639 1, \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u0631\\u0647\\u0648\\u062f, \\u062f\\u0628\\u064a, \\u0627\\u0644\\u0625\\u0645\\u0627\\u0631\\u0627\\u062a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0631\\u0628\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u062a\\u062d\\u062f\\u0629\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn\\u2019t working. Having paid \\u00a3723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was \\u00a325. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a \\u00a320 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge \\u00a34.99 per hour in economy class.\",\n          \"British Airways from Heathrow to Manchester - ok it's only a 35 min flight but about a one hour delay with no explanation before take off and no apology from the flight deck. I booked a seat near the front and was moved to the very back row 'because of a change of aircraft'. There I could hear every word of conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley.

The flight from Chicago was delayed by 3 hours with no explanation. This meant I had to sprint through LAX to make my connection, which they barely held. Once on board, my seat was cramped and the entertainment screen was broken. The food was a tasteless, lukewarm mush. To top it all off, when I finally arrived in Tokyo, my luggage was lost. It's been 48 hours and I still have no update. An absolutely abysmal experience from start to finish.\",\n",

From the moment I stepped on board, the cabin crew was attentive, professional, and genuinely welcoming, offering a glass of champagne right away. The lie-flat bed in business class was extremely comfortable, and the amenity kit was well-stocked. The three-course meal was restaurant-quality, and the wine selection was excellent. We arrived in Dubai 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and my bags were one of the first off the carousel. This is how flying should be. Highly recommended.\",\n",
